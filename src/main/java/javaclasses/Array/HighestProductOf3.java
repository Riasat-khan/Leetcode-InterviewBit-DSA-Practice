    /*Given an array of integers, find the highest product you can get from three of the integers.

The input arrayOfInts will always have at least three integers.

Gotchas
Does your method work with negative numbers? If arrayOfInts is
[-10, -10, 1, 3, 2]
we should return 300. (which we get by taking -10 * -10 * 3).

We can do this in O(n) time and O(1) space.*/

    /*Solution
We use a greedy â†´ approach to solve the problem in one pass. At each iteration we keep track of:

highestProductOf3
highestProductOf2
highest
lowestProductOf2
lowest

When we reach the end, the highestProductOf3 is our answer. We maintain the others because
they're necessary for keeping the highestProductOf3 up to date as we walk through the array.
At each iteration, the highestProductOf3 is the highest of:

the current highestProductOf3
current * highestProductOf2
current * lowestProductOf2 (if current and lowestProductOf2 are both low negative numbers,
this product is a high positive number).*/
